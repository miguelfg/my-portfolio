# Intro

I am a computer engineer and I love to work on data projects. For the last 11 years my main activities have been to develop ETLs, perform data analysis, feature engineering, geolocate data, and smaller doses of visualization and data science. I am specialized in Neo4j Graph Databases, widely used in ICIJ's tax-havens related projects, that ended-up contributing to the Offshoreleaks Database. During last years I have also acquired a ML Scientist track at DataCamp and an OSINT certification.
