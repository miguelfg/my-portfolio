<!-- description: About Miguel Fiandor, data engineer and analyst -->
<!-- type: text -->
<p>I am a computer engineer with a passion for data projects. Over the past 11 years, my professional focus has been on developing ETLs, performing data analysis, feature engineering, geolocating data, and creating visualizations. I've specialized in Neo4j Graph Databases, which have been widely used in the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' (ICIJ) tax-havens related projects, contributing significantly to the Offshoreleaks Database. In recent years, I've expanded my expertise by completing the Machine Learning Scientist track at DataCamp and acquiring an OSINT certification.</p>
<p>Since June 2015, I've been part of both the Tech and Data &amp; Research teams at the ICIJ, participating in nine internationally acclaimed investigative projects including the Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, FinCEN Files, and Pandora Papers. These projects have collectively earned over 50 recognized investigative journalism awards, including a Pulitzer Prize. My responsibilities have included transforming millions of documents into structured databases, web scraping, PDF extraction and parsing, data standardization and analysis, dashboarding, feature extraction, geolocation, country classification, and Graph DB creation and management. I've also contributed to optimizing research tasks, improving searches, finding new data sources, and collaborating in the development of tools like Prophecies and Datashare Tarentula.</p>
<p>When I'm not immersed in data projects, I enjoy my two growing-fast minions and staying active through padel and climbing with friends. I try to work on my not-recognised-as-they-should (:-P) musical skills by playing piano.</p>
