I am a freelance data analyst and engineer with a focus on data journalism and open source reasearch (OSINT) projects. I am specialized in the following areas:

This includes web scraping projects or complex PDF processing, to extract and structure data from the web or internal docs, as carried out in prize-awarded ICIJ projects like the [Panama Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/), [Fincen Files](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/), Paradise Papers, Implant Files, etc.
